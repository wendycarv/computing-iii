Purpose: This program opens a file with movie names and their respective ratings, adds this information to a multimap, along with the order they appear in to a vector, and how many ratings for each movie to a normal map. It then uses this data to calculate the average of ratings for each their movie and prints this out in the order in which they originally appeared in the input file.
